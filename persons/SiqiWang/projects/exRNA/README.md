## HCC and healthy plasma cell-free exRNA-seq generated by lulab
---

**Dateset**: plasma cell-free exRNA-seq generated by lulab

**Location**: /BioII/lulab_b/shared/projects/exRNA/

**Date**: Apr 15, 2018

**Maintainer**: Siqi Wang

 **Description**: 
* Plasma samples were collected from HCC patients (before/after surgery) and normal people.
* 00.rawdata/: R1.fastq and R2.fastq files.
* 01.cutadapt/: Remove adapter and trim low quality base from end of each reads by cutadapt toolkit. The 51-150 nt of R1 reads were forced trimed from 3`end.
* 02.rRNA/: Remove ribosomal RNA reads by bowtie2.
* 03.mapping/: bam files generated from bowtie2. Maping order: miRNA, piRNA, Y RNA, snRNA, srpRNA, tRNA, lncRNA, mRNA, human genome.
